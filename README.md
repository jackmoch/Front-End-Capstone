## PROPOSAL
### The Ones and Twos
A good book deserves a fitting soundtrack. Perfect Pairs is designed to suggest a variety of records to compliment what you
are currently reading. Break out your bindings, curl up in your most comfortable chair and settle in with you Perfect Pair.

### Notes
- I designed this application as a reader and music junkie. I love finding new music and the idea of discovering a record
based on a book I was reading really excited me so I ran with it!
- The current pairing methodology requires me to build my own data table as a .json file which is a somewhat tedious process, so
some searches may not return results simply because I haven't yet paired their keywords. 
- A constant work in progress!!!
